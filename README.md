# COVID19-Global-Analysis
In this notebook, I will be performing a global analysis on COVID-19 by using real time data provided by John Hopkins. I will be looking at 3 important features: deaths, confirmed cases and recovered cases. I will also make use of the ipywidgets package to make some graphs interactive for the user.

It is best to view this notebook on https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to be able to see the plots.
